    "Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics involves the collection and presentation of data in a way that allows us to describe the characteristics of a set of data. Descriptive statistics can be further divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Measures of central tendency: These measures help to describe the central location of a set of data. For example, the mean, median, and mode are measures of central tendency. The mean is used when the data is normally distributed, while the median is used when the data is skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Measures of dispersion: These measures help to describe the spread or variability of a set of data. For example, the range, standard deviation, and variance are measures of dispersion. \n",
    "Example: Descriptive statistics can be used to describe the average salary of employees in a company. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics involves using sample data to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population. Inferential statistics allows us to test hypotheses, estimate parameters, and make predictions about the population based on sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Inferential statistics can be used to determine whether a new drug is effective in treating a particular disease. A sample of patients can be given the drug, and another sample can be given a placebo. The results from the two samples can be compared using inferential statistics to determine whether the drug is effective in treating the disease."
